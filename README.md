# AutoHotkey
Keyboard Layouts and stuff for advanced (mac) users

License: GNU GPL v2

Right now this repo contains only one AutoHotkey script to do the following thing:

**Make the usage of Windows as painless as possible for Mac-Users that got used to U.S. keyboard layout.**

It works fine for me in following settings:

* Windows 7
* **Apple-Keyboards with English Layouts**
* VirtualBox under OSX (okay, some minor problems with German Umlauts)
* support/remap of common IntelliJ shortcuts

** Try it, have fun and give feedback by supplying merge-requestes :) **
